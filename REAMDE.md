# My Processing Projects

During my computer science undergraduate course I created a lot of processing sketches. Processing is a Java library with its own IDE. Processing is often used to teach Java programming.

## Demonstration

Sketches that I made to understand some concepts i.e. monte carlo method, bezier curves, graph traversal etc. better.

## Editor Apps

Sketches that are made to create something else i.e. a drawing or an animation.

## p5.js

Sketches that were written in javascript to run inside a browser.
